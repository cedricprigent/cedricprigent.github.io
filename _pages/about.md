#### Bio
Welcome to my personal webpage ! 
Since September 2025, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [DRIM](https://liris.cnrs.fr/equipe/drim) team at LIRIS (Lyon), under the supervision of Sonia Ben Mokhtar. 
From November 2021 to May 2025, I did my PhD at Inria Rennes in the KerData team, under the supervision of Alexandru Costan, Gabriel Antoniu and Lo√Øc Cudennec.

My research interests include **privacy-preserving**, **robust** and **personalized** Federated Learning in **heterogenous** and **constrained** environments.
